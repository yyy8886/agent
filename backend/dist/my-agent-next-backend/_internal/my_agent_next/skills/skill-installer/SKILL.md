# Skill Installer

Helps install skills. By default these are from https://github.com/openai/skills/tree/main/skills/.curated, but users can also provide other locations. Experimental skills live in https://github.com/openai/skills/tree/main/skills/.experimental and can be installed the same way.

Use the helper scripts based on the task:
- List skills when the user asks what is available, or if the user uses this skill without specifying what to do. Default listing is `.curated`, but you can pass `--path skills/.experimental` when they ask about experimental skills.
- Install from the curated list when the user provides a skill name.
- Install from another repo when the user provides a GitHub repo/path (including private repos).

Install skills with the helper scripts.

## Source integrity

Treat a result as an official OpenAI Skill listing only when it was obtained directly from the
`openai/skills` GitHub repository through the bundled scripts, GitHub API, raw GitHub content, or a
successful git checkout of that repository. Do not use search-engine snippets, DeepWiki, blogs,
mirrors, cached catalogs, or other third-party pages to reconstruct or verify an official list.

If every direct official source fails, stop and report the exact official-source failure. Do not
continue general web search, guess names, combine remembered entries, or label third-party data as
official. A partial official response must be labeled partial rather than completed from another
source.

Before stating that installation or listing succeeded, require machine-verifiable evidence:

- Listing: valid output produced from a direct official source.
- Installation: the destination exists, contains a valid `SKILL.md`, and matches the requested
  repository path.

Never install merely because the user asks what is available or asks how installation works.

## Communication

When listing skills, output approximately as follows, depending on the context of the user's request. If they ask about experimental skills, list from `.experimental` instead of `.curated` and label the source accordingly:
"""
Skills from {repo}:
1. skill-1
2. skill-2 (already installed)
3. ...
Which ones would you like installed?
"""

After installing a skill, tell the user it will be available on their next turn.

## Scripts

All of these scripts use network, so when running in the sandbox, request escalation when running them.

- `scripts/list-skills.py` (prints skills list with installed annotations)
- `scripts/list-skills.py --format json`
- Example (experimental list): `scripts/list-skills.py --path skills/.experimental`
- `scripts/install-skill-from-github.py --repo <owner>/<repo> --path <path/to/skill> [<path/to/skill> ...]`
- `scripts/install-skill-from-github.py --url https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/tree/<ref>/<path>`
- Example (experimental skill): `scripts/install-skill-from-github.py --repo openai/skills --path skills/.experimental/<skill-name>`

## Behavior and Options

- Defaults to direct download for public GitHub repos.
- If download fails with auth/permission errors, falls back to git sparse checkout.
- Aborts if the destination skill directory already exists.
- Installs into this application's `skills/<skill-name>/` directory by default. `--dest <path>` overrides that destination explicitly.
- Multiple `--path` values install multiple skills in one run, each named from the path basename unless `--name` is supplied.
- Options: `--ref <ref>` (default `main`), `--dest <path>`, `--method auto|download|git`.

## Notes

- Curated listing is fetched from `https://github.com/openai/skills/tree/main/skills/.curated` via the GitHub API. If it is unavailable, explain the error and exit.
- After that failure, do not fall back to third-party search or documentation for an official list.
- Private GitHub repos can be accessed via existing git credentials or optional `GITHUB_TOKEN`/`GH_TOKEN` for download.
- Git fallback tries HTTPS first, then SSH.
- The skills at https://github.com/openai/skills/tree/main/skills/.system are preinstalled, so no need to help users install those. If they ask, just explain this. If they insist, you can download and overwrite.
- Installed annotations come from this application's `skills/` directory.
